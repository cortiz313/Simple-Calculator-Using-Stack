# Simple-Calculator-Using-Stack
This program is a simple calculator that implements Stack objects to perform addition and subtraction operations, including the proper use of parentheses.

The program receives an expression like 95 − (12 + 33) from the keyboard and prints out the result (50 in this case) on the screen.
The input expression may include nested parentheses like

2 + (1 − (3 + ((4 − 1) + (12 − 6))))

Therefore, your program uses the stack data structure to store the intermediate results of inner parentheses and/or the operators.
